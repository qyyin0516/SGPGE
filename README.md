# SGPGE
Implementation of SGPGE and some methods compared, including traditional methods (PCA, LDA, LPP, SPP) and SGPGE's variants (SPGE, LGPGE, GGPGE).

SGPGE is short for sparsity and geometry preserving graph embedding. It is an algorithm for dimensionality reduction of images, proposed by Gou et al. (doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2884027). In this project, we reproduced the SGPGE method and compared with other methods on the ORL face dataset.
